Stock Sage is a web-based dashboard designed to help a business owner ("Regular Shop" user Rajesh Namnode) manage their store's key operations. It centralizes inventory control, billing/invoicing, and business performance analytics into a single, easy-to-use interface.

**Key Features & Modules**
1. Dashboard (The Command Center)
This is the main landing page that provides a high-level, "at-a-glance" summary of the store's current status.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Prominently displays essential metrics like:

Total Products

Low Stock Alerts

Today's Sales (₹0.00)

Monthly Sales (₹3,084.08)

Data Visualizations:

Sales Trend (Last 7 Days): A line chart to visualize recent sales performance.

Top Selling Products: A bar chart showing which products are most popular.

Actionable Widgets:

Recent Bills: A list of the latest transactions with their status (e.g., pending, paid, cancelled), allowing for quick review.

Low Stock Alerts: A critical list that flags products running low on inventory (e.g., Kissan Tomato Ketchup, Chivda), enabling proactive restocking.

Quick Actions: A set of buttons at the bottom for the most common tasks: Add New Product, Create Bill, and View Analytics.

2. Products (Inventory Management)
This module is the core of the inventory system. It allows the user to manage their entire product catalog.

Product Listing: A clean table view of all products with key details:

Product Image, Name, and Description

Category (e.g., Baby Care, Clothes, Grocery)

Price

Stock (Quantity on hand)

Status (e.g., In Stock, Low Stock - visually distinguished with color-coded tags)

Functionality:

Search & Filter: Users can search for specific products and filter by category.

CRUD Operations: Implies full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities with the + Add Product button and the edit/delete icons in the "Actions" column.

3. Bills & Invoices (Sales & Billing)
This section tracks all sales transactions and customer invoices.

Bill Listing: A detailed log of all bills, showing:

Bill Details (Unique ID and Timestamp)

Customer Name and Contact

Total Amount and Number of Items

Status (Pending, Paid, Cancelled)

Payment Method (e.g., UPI, Card, Netbanking, Cash)

Functionality:

Search & Filter: Comprehensive filtering options by search term, status, and date range (Start Date, End Date).

Actions: An action button per bill, which could be for viewing details, printing, or sending the invoice.

Bill Creation: A + Create Bill button to generate new sales entries.

4. Analytics & Reports (Business Intelligence)
This is a powerful module for tracking business performance and gaining insights from sales data.

High-Level Metrics: A summary section shows overall performance for the selected time period:

Total Revenue (₹3,084.08)

Total Orders (5)

Average Order Value (₹616.82)

Total Products Sold (90)

Data Visualization Charts:

Sales Trend: A line chart showing revenue over time.

Orders Trend: A bar chart showing the number of orders per day.

Top Products by Revenue: A pie chart breaking down revenue contribution by product (e.g., Chivda 39%, Maggi 15%).

Average Order Value: A line chart tracking the average transaction value over time.

Dynamic Filtering: Users can dynamically filter all analytics data by preset ranges (Today, Week, Month, Quarter) or a custom date range. They can also change the data grouping (e.g., Daily).

UI/UX & Technical Assessment
Design: The design is clean, professional, and highly functional. The consistent use of whitespace, clear typography, intuitive icons, and color-coded status badges makes the application very user-friendly.

Architecture: This is a classic example of a full-stack Single Page Application (SPA). Given your skill set, it's likely built with a stack like:

Frontend: React (or a similar framework) using a component-based architecture. The charts could be implemented with libraries like Chart.js or Recharts. The styling looks like it could be done with Tailwind CSS.

Backend: A Node.js and Express.js server providing REST APIs to fetch and manipulate data.

Database: A MongoDB database is a great fit for storing the product, bill, and customer data in a flexible, document-oriented way.

Potential Enhancements & Next Steps
This project is already very strong, but if you wanted to elevate it further (to the "9 LPA-level" standard you're aiming for with DevBoard), here are some ideas:

User Roles & Permissions: Introduce different user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Cashier) with varying levels of access. A cashier might only be able to create bills, while a manager can view analytics and manage products.

Customer Management (CRM): Add a dedicated "Customers" module to track customer purchase history and contact details.

Barcode/QR Code Integration: Allow for scanning product barcodes to add them to a bill quickly, which is a standard feature in real-world POS systems.

Reporting Exports: Add functionality to export analytics reports and bill lists as PDF or CSV files.

Real-time Notifications: Implement real-time low-stock alerts via web sockets or email notifications to the store owner.
